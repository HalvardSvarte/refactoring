# Refactoring workshop
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to refactor the class <code>Status</code> in the project <code>RefactorThis</code>.  Your possibilites are limited by the code in the project <code>DoNotRefactor</code> which you are not allowed to refactor.  Think of them as external dependencies outside of your control.  You are helped by the unit tests in the project <code>Tests</code>.  The tests are all correct (although not necessarily pretty) and must all pass after you refactor.  
  
Start before the workshop if you want to as there will be limited time at the workshop.  And please feel free to make a pull request on your solution.  
  
Good luck!
